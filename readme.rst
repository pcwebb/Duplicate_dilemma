Grace is an 87 year old head of a non-profit business. For decades, the 
office has run the same way. Computers were used, but not to their full 
capabilities. A younger volunteer has suggested updating the companyâ€™s 
website and developing an email marketing list. She has multiple paper 
mailing lists for snail mail as far back as 1996. Grace would love to 
eliminate the pages and pages of duplicates efficiently, reduce her 
postal costs and move into the twenty-first century.


*****************
Problem Scenarios
*****************

Grace searches through the list eliminating each duplicate manually which
wastes  time and money.


Current Alternatives
====================

Creating a program to digitize the list and eliminate the duplicates. Also, 
creating a system to match fields and weed out extraneous information, 
as well as counting and generating separate list to categorize clients.


Value Proposition
==================

By creating a program to digitized contact files and search for duplicated 
contacts, Grace could more efficiently and effectively market her clients.
